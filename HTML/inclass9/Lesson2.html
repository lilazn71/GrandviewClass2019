<pre>A poem is a collection of spoken or written words 
    that expresses ideas or emotions in a 
    powerfully vivid and imaginative style. 
    A poem is comprised of a particular rhythmic and 
    metrical pattern. In fact, it is a literary technique 
    that is different from prose or ordinary speech, 
    as it is either in metrical pattern or in free verse. 
    Writers or poets express their emotions through this medium more easily, as they face difficulty when expressing through some other medium. 
    It serves the purpose of a light to take the readers towards the right path. Also, sometimes it teaches them a moral lesson through sugar-coated language.</pre>
